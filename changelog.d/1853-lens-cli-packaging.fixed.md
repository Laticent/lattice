- **Fixed: the published CLI can run `--lens`, read-along and chart narration.** `dist/lattice-emulator.js`
  left `require("@workwel/lente")` and three `require("@workwel/cadenza")` calls bare, and those are
  npm-workspace members: they resolve through a symlink in this repo and resolve nowhere after
  `npm install @workwel/lattice`. The CLI bundle now inlines the workspace packages like the rest of
  the local graph, so `--lens`, read-along, chart narration and the caption kernel run outside a
  clone. Verified by running a `--lens` export with those packages made unresolvable.
