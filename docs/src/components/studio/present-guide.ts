// THE GUIDE RUNG — pointing at the part of the slide currently being narrated (#1397).
//
// CC shows the words, Voice speaks them, Guide shows you WHERE TO LOOK. Three independent
// toggles over one narration.
//
// ── Where the targets come from, and why NOT from the projection ───────────────────────────
//
// The design record proposed sourcing targets from `projectDeckSpeech`, on the grounds that it
// "already knows which DOM node each sentence came from and throws it away". Reading the
// pipeline, that is half true and the half that is false is the load-bearing half:
//
//   `speakGeneric` (lib/transformers/prose-projection.mjs) does hold `el` alongside its text —
//   but per BLOCK, not per sentence, and it joins those blocks into ONE string per slide.
//   Sentences do not exist yet at that point. They are created much later and somewhere else,
//   by `buildTrack` segmenting the projected string in read-aloud.ts.
//
// So there is no per-sentence node to keep. Threading one through would mean carrying node
// identity across four string-only boundaries — the projection primitives, `normalizeProjected`,
// the `string[]` return that both Present AND the CLI export consume, and `buildTrack`'s cue
// construction — i.e. changing the shared export kernel's contract for a Studio-only feature.
//
// Worse, it would be threading identity through the WRONG DOCUMENT. The projection parses a
// detached copy of the render; the slide a viewer is looking at is a live iframe whose DOM the
// runtime has since mutated (Mermaid inflated, charts drawn, KaTeX typeset). A node from the
// detached parse is not a node you can point at.
//
// So Guide resolves LATE, against the live frame, by matching the cue's DISPLAY text to the
// smallest block that contains it. That works on every existing deck with zero authoring —
// which was the actual requirement — costs the shared kernel nothing, and is robust to whatever
// the runtime did to the DOM after render, because it reads the DOM that is on screen.
//
// ── The two named constraints ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// CROSS-FRAME. Vetrina's stage sits over the live app and never enters a preview iframe. The
// slide IS an iframe. Handled by `RectSource` (the target widening from #1400) fed by the shared
// `frame-geom` bridge — so the library still knows nothing about frames.
//
// ONE CONDUCTOR. Read-aloud owns the clock. Nothing here has a timer: the cursor moves when the
// reader says the cue changed, full stop. A second clock (Vetrina's storyboard `readMs` dwell)
// would drift against the audio within a slide and point at the wrong thing — which is the
// most likely way this feature ships feeling broken.

 *  degrades into "does this block have at least as many words" and the cursor lands on an
 *  arbitrary line, confidently. (CJK collapses to the empty string and merely goes silent.)
