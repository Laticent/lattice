# How to style a chart

The contract for anyone — human or agent — changing how a chart *looks*. Creating
a new chart member is a different job: that is `design/skills/chart-component.md`.
This is about paint, weight and spacing on the 21 members that exist.

**One sentence: structure belongs to the family, colour belongs to the palette and
the finish, and neither is allowed to do the other's job.**

---

## 1 · The split, and why it is the whole discipline

| | who owns it | what it means |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | the chart family, globally | edge weight, corner radius, the gap between marks, spacing |
| **Colour** | the theme's palette, moved by the finish | which hue, how deep, which channel carries identity |

A chart member **never tunes structure for itself.** If a bar's outline looks too
heavy, the fix is the family token, not that member's stylesheet — because if it
looks wrong there it is wrong everywhere, and a per-member fix guarantees the set
stops reading as one system.

This is not a style preference. It is the lesson of the defect that made this
document necessary: 19 mark edges painting at **16 different physical weights**,
a 13.1× spread, every one of them a local decision that looked right in
isolation.

## 2 · The coordinate-space trap — read this before touching any `stroke-width`

**An SVG `stroke-width` is in viewBox user units, not pixels.** The family's
viewBoxes range from 24 units (a journey mood face) to 1375 (a world map), and
they render into boxes from 32px to 1152px wide. So the same literal means a
different painted weight on every member, and a number tuned by eye on one chart
is meaningless on the next.

Measure it, never reason about it:

```
node .scratch/charts/probe-edge.js        # physical weight per mark, before/after
node .scratch/finishes/structure.js base  # every width, radius and gap in the family
```

**The rule:** a data mark's edge comes from `var(--chart-edge)` and carries
`vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke`. That pairing is load-bearing in both
directions — `non-scaling-stroke` strips the viewBox scaling so the weight is
comparable across members, and `--chart-edge` resolves to the family's
`clamp(1px, 0.078cqi, 2px)` so it still grows with the container above HD (#180).
Use one without the other and you break one of the two properties.

`chart-mark-edge-census.test.js` ties the shared rule's class list to the marks
each manifest declares `paint: "fill"`, so a new member joins by declaring its
marks — not by editing CSS.

### The structural tokens

| token | value | use |
|---|---|---|
| `--chart-edge` | `var(--chart-hairline)` → 1px @HD | every data mark's outline |
| `--chart-edge-strong` | `calc(… * 2)` → 2px | hero series and the active mark, nothing else |
| `--chart-hairline` | `clamp(1px, 0.078cqi, 2px)` | DOM borders, rules, separators |
| `--chart-fill-accent` | `clamp(4px, 0.31cqi, 7px)` | a mark's leading-edge accent stripe |
| `--chart-mark-radius` | `0.46875cqi` | a mark's corner |

**A text halo is not a mark edge.** `paint-order: stroke` on a label uses
`stroke-width` to fatten a readability outline around glyphs. Those are deliberate
and must not be folded into `--chart-edge`; the census test skips any rule
carrying `paint-order`.

## 3 · The three finishes

A finish moves colour; it never adds or removes it, and it never touches
structure.

| | identity lives in | choose it for | body | edge |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`pigment`** | the body's **hue** | you want colour | 82% | ink, 1× |
| **`etching`** | the **line and the letter** | a modern look | 30/40% | ink, 1× |
| **`tone`** | the body's **value**, one hue | a conservative, restrained look | 92…9% of one hue | ink, 1× |

`pigment` is the default. Two things hold in **all three**, and they are floors,
not style:

1. **Every mark carries an ink edge.** Measured: no body clears the 3:1 graphical
   floor against its own canvas at any depth — 82% bottoms out at 2.45:1, and 30%
   clears it in **0 of 224** theme × mode × slot combinations — while the ink
   clears it everywhere (worst 4.65:1). A body never guarantees the mark can be
   seen. Its edge does.
2. **Every element that NAMES a mark wears that mark's ink.** No finish removes
   colour. Under `tone` there is one hue, so a name wears the ink — the same
   channel the edge uses. Sending names to a neutral is a floor violation, and it
   is an easy one to write by accident because it looks like an accommodation.

Full philosophy: `engineering/decisions/2026-09-07-chart-design-language/` —
`tone-is-the-third-finish.md` for the trio, `finish-render-defects.md` for what
goes wrong.

## 4 · Contrast — what to measure, and against what

**Against everything on the slide, not against the canvas.** A mark sits on
whatever is painted behind it, which may be a card, a panel, a tint, another mark,
or several of those composited.

```
node .scratch/charts/solve.js <rendered.html> [screen|print]
```

Floors: **4.5:1** for text, **3:1** for large (≥24px, or ≥18.66px bold) and for
any graphical object carrying information (WCAG 1.4.11). A mark passes on **either**
channel — body-vs-backdrop or edge-vs-backdrop — because `etching` leans on the
edge by design.

### Six ways a contrast measurement lies

Every one of these produced a wrong number in this repo before it was fixed. If
you write a new instrument, check it against all six.

1. **The presentation attribute is not the paint.** `fill="url(#g)"` still reads
   `url()` after CSS has overridden it. Read computed style, always.
2. **SVG text paints with `fill`, HTML text with `color`.** Reading `color` first
   scores an SVG label with an ink it is not drawn in.
3. **A colour carries its own alpha.** `color(srgb 0 .4 .6 / 0.1)` is a 10% wash;
   dropping the fourth channel turns it into a saturated fill and invents failures.
4. **A gradient resolves through `getComputedStyle(stop).stopColor`** — the
   attribute still carries `var()`, which a canvas cannot resolve.
5. **A bounding box lies.** Use `isPointInFill` for SVG, and a `Range` for text —
   a table cell's *box* reaches the row rule its *glyphs* never touch.
6. **`<text>`, `<tspan>` and `<g>` do not paint.** Counting them as surfaces makes
   every label its own backdrop and scores it at exactly 1:1.

And one that is not about measurement at all: **contrast and distinctness are
different questions.** A chart whose five categories all painted one colour passed
every contrast audit in this repo, because one colour is perfectly legible. If you
change how marks take paint, run the flattening detector too:

```
node .scratch/finishes/flatten.js    # distinct paints per mark class vs the baseline
```

## 5 · The order to verify in

Nothing here is optional, and the order matters — a later step is meaningless if
an earlier one moved.

1. `npm run build` — the CSS you edited is not what renders until you do.
2. **Re-render**, then measure. Measuring a stale render is the single most common
   way to report a fix that did not happen.
3. `node .scratch/finishes/structure.js base` — did the structural spread move?
4. `node .scratch/charts/solve.js … screen` **and** `… print`. `@media print` is
   live in the CLI vector PDF path, so a screen measurement does not prove the PDF.
5. `node .scratch/finishes/flatten.js` — did an encoding collapse?
6. `npm run lint`, `npm run build:check`, `npm test`.
7. **Look at it.** Rasterize and open the pages. Every instrument above has a blind
   spot; your eyes are what catch a mark that is legible, distinct, correctly
   weighted and still ugly.

**Themes are part of verification, not a follow-up.** Light and dark for every
theme the change can reach, plus the five `a11y-*` themes and print. An `a11y`
theme replaces the categorical palette with textures and greys, so a change that
assumes hue is available breaks there and nowhere else.

## 6 · Traps this family has already paid for

- **A `:not()` fallback at equal specificity, emitted last, overrides everything
  it was meant to back up.** One line collapsed an entire finish.
- **`:nth-of-type` counts same-tag siblings.** One `<span>` per `<td>` means every
  element is position 1, and per-slot rules silently become one rule.
- **A `var()` fallback chain takes the first DEFINED name.** One early name defined
  globally shadows every per-slot name after it.
- **A CSS rule beats a `fill=` presentation attribute**, so a finish can overwrite
  a correct per-category paint with a constant and the legend beside it will still
  show the truth.
- **`build:galleries --check` compares render inputs against HEAD.** Commit a CSS
  change and it reports "no change" while every PDF is stale. Rebuild on the
  strength of what you changed, not on what it says.
- **A mark that carries no datum is ground, not figure.** Painting it at body depth
  made a choropleth's no-data countries darker than its data.
